								<p>I am an aspiring software engineer who is driven to always contribute with noticeable impact. Enjoys adding creative and unique features that can enhance any project. Strives to learn and expand my knowledge about current technology and applications. Strong work ethic, excellent people and communication skills, and a highly collaborative spirit.  
								</p>
								<p>Recently, I completed my journey of coding for four years to land a Computer Science BS degree! I spent years exploring different technologies, collaborating on projects and working on some projects on my own. My interests lie in AI, full-stack development, containerization, and game development. Seeking a bit more time to identify the most fitting path, I made a decision to pursue a Master's degree in Software Engineering. 
								</p>
								<p>Currently, my coding journey is focused on creating my capstone project, Planet Creation Simulation, which leverages artificial intelligence within the Unreal Engine to dynamically build scientifically inspired planets, incorporating user input. This simulation aims to ensure procedural generation aligns with contemporary scientific principles, offering players an immersive experience. 
								</p>
								<p>During my two summer internships at First American Data & Analytics, I not only honed my technical skills but also developed crucial non-technical capabilities. Collaborating with a diverse team of 15 offshore developers improved my ability to communicate complex technical concepts effectively, ensuring an effective transfer of knowledge. Working within an Agile environment, I learned about the importance of adaptability and effective teamwork. Presenting in-person demonstrations to VPs and Directors, notably enhanced my communication and presentation skills. These experiences highlighted the importance of having a well-rounded skill set outside of just the technical prowess in the field of software engineering.  
								</p>
								<p>But coding is not just about having the 1s and 0s! What I believe is most important is clear communication and collaboration. If you do not get along with your team how will you defeat the BBEG (Big Bad Evil Guy)? In the end, how will you create the best project you can without the right attitude? Computer Science is so much more than working on logic, it's about building something great with a group of likeminded people.
