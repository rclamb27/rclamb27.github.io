								<p>Aspiring software engineer with a relentless drive to contribute meaningfully to projects. I derive joy from integrating creative and unique features that enhance the overall impact of any endeavor. My commitment to continuous learning and expanding my knowledge in current technology and applications is unwavering.</p>
								<p>In the past two years, I've had the opportunity to work on two game projects and participated in a 24-hour code jam with the CSUF Video Game Development Club. This experience introduced me to Unity and C#, and allowed me to collaborate with a diverse team of programmers, artists, and game designers. I was also working on a project that involves analyzing data related to the Titanic Disaster to predict the likelihood of survival. I also have an exciting idea to gather data from various news websites to predict the impact on stocks, assessing the probability of their rise or fall.
								</p>
								<p>In my future in software engineering, I am actively engaged in cutting-edge projects, leveraging the knowledge gained from my ongoing master's program to drive innovation and make substantial contributions to the field. My current focus is on a groundbreaking initiativeâ€”the Planet Creation Simulation. Leveraging artificial intelligence within the Unreal Engine, this project dynamically constructs scientifically inspired planets, incorporating user input. The simulation aims to ensure procedural generation aligns with contemporary scientific principles, providing players with an immersive experience.
								</p>
								<p>This journey reflects my dedication to staying at the forefront of technological advancements, embracing challenges, and making substantial contributions to the field. I am excited about the possibilities that lie ahead as I continue to evolve in the dynamic realm of software engineering.
